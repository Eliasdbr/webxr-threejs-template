## Objective

The objective of this project is to make a WebXR ready Template with Three.js, that is aimed for making VR games.

The idea is to have pre-built tools for making levels, scenes and objects to start fast a VR Game project that runs on the web.

## Motivation

Why? Why WebXR? Why not a native engine like Unity, or Unreal?

Because I have an Oculus GO (yes, pretty old) but I can't seem to find a way to make a proper game with the other engines that still support this device.

So my first platform on which I will test this project on, is the Oculus GO.

## Instalation

Clone this template and run the command:
```
npm install
```

## Run the project

Run the next command:

```
npm run dev -- --host
```
This command will start a **https** server that will host the project.

You can launch it from your browser through the **localhost** url, or from another WebXR capable device's browser that's connected on the same local network.

**Note:** *If you try to connect to the server from another local device, the browser will show a warning about the connection not being safe, and it recommends you to step back. This is fine. In the same page, you can select "Advanced options" and "Enter anyways".*

## Deploy

I haven't tested this part yet, so when I do it, I will update this section.

## Contribution

I also need to figure this out yet...
